      Yes, it can be quite overwhelming to suddenly have to arrange a funeral for a loved one. Contact us on [08 8427 7099](tel:0884277099) and we will put you in touch with a professional funeral arranger who can take care of everything for you.

  - title: Can I purchase a personalised coffin directly from you?

      Lifestyle coffins are only available through our national network of reputable funeral homes.

  - title: Do personalised coffins take long to finish?
    body: |
      It doesn’t take us any longer to produce a Lifestyle personalised Coffin with your chosen design than it would to produce any other coffin. We stock loads of coffins of all sizes ready for personalising. Our personalised coffins are completed within 24 hours of artwork approval, so rest assured it won’t delay the funeral arrangements.

  - title: My Funeral Home does not offer personalised coffins, what do I do?
    body: |
      Personalised coffins are still relatively new to some funeral professionals, and your chosen funeral director may not be familiar with personalised coffins. If this is the case, you can contact us on [08 8427 7099](tel:0884277099) and we can advise what to do and recommend a reputable funeral home that can provide a Lifestyle Coffin for you.

  - title: I am not good at design, who does the coffin artwork?
    body: |
      Dont worry, we take care of the design. Our graphic designers create stunning custom designs from your brief and photos that you provide to us. We send you a full colour 3D proof of the design for your approval before printing. Visuals are emailed to you within 24 hours of receiving your brief and then we can make any changes that you want.
