In an early blog post we explained [what you needed to know before moving into a retirement village](#). This article provides more detail about the rights you have and need to be aware of before signing a retirement village contract.

## Required documents before you sign a retirement village contract:

Before entering into a retirement village, the operator is required to give you the following documentation at least 10 business days before you sign a residence contract:

1. copy of the residence contract
2. disclosure statement
3. financial statements presented at the last Annual Meeting of the village and a written statement of any subsequent changes in the affairs of the village and the operator (which may significantly affect your decision to enter the village)
4. copy of the minutes of the last two annual meetings of the village
5. copy of the residence rules
6. the operatorâ€™s remarketing policy
7. any code of conduct applicable
8. any other documents prescribed by the regulations (see [Retirement Villages Act 2016](#) )
It is common for a retirement village operator to provide all of the above documents in one bundle or in a folder. Of those documents, the first two are often the most important.
